Changing the course of your life at any age through vision, focus and preservation. 
My name is Tanisha Smith, age 38 years young, divorced super mom, driven woman with a unknown concrete purpose but I remind myself I am the driver so I'm consently exploring all my options which are limitless. I fall off course sometimes but I get up better every time so could it really be falling off? Life learner, visionary, career in the higher learning branch of IT, bringing ideas to the table, being creative, following through on what I promise to deliver and commited to my work. The most important lesson I have learned in life is to love and appreciate my journey and that there is beauty in my struggles, they keep me motivated, humble and having a fresh perception. Dedicating my life to God, my daughter, my family and my ancestors who shed blood and tears for me to be where I am in life.
